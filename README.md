# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Our purpose for this project for the School District Analysis was to look at the school districts reading and math school along with indiviudal shcools characteritistcs. We are using both Python Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to examine and conduct or school district analysis data. In our conduction of the analysis we use jupyter notebook to import our school data from our resources folder sothat we can examine andtake a closer look at this school district and its traits like scores, performances, spending and more. We also aim at one school Thomas High to provide some better information on its characteristics as a school program.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
This diagram shows how the district summary was affected after we were able to clean up the NaNs.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
This data shows and affects Thomas High Schools performance in a better way and shows that we are able to find a more accurate discription of the schools grades in math and reading.

- Math and reading scores by grade?
In this diagram we are able to look at the math and reading scores by grade to determine better resutls for our school districts analysis

- Scores by school spending?
We can see the differences in each schools spending in the same school district and how it could potnetially correlate to greater or lesser success for students.

## Summary

We can take away four main points about our school district analysis and examining Thomas High School. 
1. We can depict from our graphs and tables created that Thomas High School took a climb in performance from being low to alot higher than before our updated testing.
2. Thomas High school after we wer ableto realize how low the 9th grade passing percentagee was was removed, and we can see that we are now in the Medium(1000-2000) range
3. After conducting a better analysis as far as the averages, we wer able to find hte exact counts of math reading and percentages passing for all 15 schools easily prior to our unedidt distirict summary. We were ableto find through the Charter Type school Thomas High that they were able to reach a 60% overall passing instread of the pervious 90% before, a big change for our district analysis.
4.the reading and math passing percentages both raised and dropped dramaticcally. Passing raised all the way to 97% and math went to 66%.
